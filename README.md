# TODOs

This is the required TODO List which was asked of.

The ephys file is the modified element-array-ephys Ephys recording for Intan Technology.

The automate data file helps us to automate the different metadata such as session, subjects, probe, etc.

Whereas, the probe file includes the type of Cambridge probe as a function and how it will work with electrodes.

We have also included the create_electrode_test file which defines the Cambridge Probe Test.
